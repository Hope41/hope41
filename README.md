## Hi, I'm an Indie Game Developer! 👾

Why hello there! I'm Hope41, an independent developer who creates fully-featured online games in pure JavaScript.

#### Check out my games at [joachimford.uk](https://joachimford.uk)!

### Trivial Information
- 👾 You can call me J-oh for short!
- 📧 I like it when people email me
- ⭐ I really like stars! (like, GitHub ones. Although of course I have nothing against normal stars)
- 🎹 I play piano sometimes!
- 💬 Game feedback is welcome! Constructive criticism goes a long way ~

### Slightly Less Trivial Information
- 🔧 I'm currently doing a super massive update on my website, rewritten from scratch. Stay posted!
- 🚧 Making a tool to help game developers and artists generate 2D worlds with ease by utilising procedural generation
- ⚙️ Getting prepared for the upcoming Gamdev.js competition 2025 by making another simple (but comprehensive, hopefully) 2D level creation tool. The tool will be posted on my website when complete
